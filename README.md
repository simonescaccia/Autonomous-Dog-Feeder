# Autonomous-Dog-Feeder

## What is the problem and why do you need IoT?

Problems we want to solve:

- Dogs have a daily amount of food they need to eat, according to their age, activity level, and health condition. This amount of food is suggested by the vet or written on the dog food package. We want to make sure that the dog gets the right amount of food every day.
- Dogs need to eat their food into several meals throughout the day. Each meal should be served at a specific time, according to the dog's age and activity level. We want to make sure that the dog gets the right amount of food at the right time.
- Dog owners may not be able to feed their dogs on time due to work or other commitments.
- Water is essential for dogs. We want to make sure that the dog has access to water at all times.

How we can monitor the environment?

- Food:
  - We want to measure the amount of food left in the bowl, in order to be albe to define the amount of food for each meal. We can use a load cell sensor to measure the weight of the food left in the bowl.
